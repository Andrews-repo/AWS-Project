Microservices

* Refactor your EB website into ONLY providing an API. It should only have a POST/GET to update/retrieve that specific data from DynamoDB. Bonus: Make it a simple REST API. Get rid of www.yourdomain.com and serve this EB as [api.apcloudtech.com](https://api.apcloudtech.com)
* Move most of the UI piece of your EB website into your Static S3 Website and use Javascript/whatever to retrieve the data from your api.yourdomain.com URL on page load. Send data to the EB URL to have it update the DynamoDB. Get rid of static.yourdomain.com and change your S3 bucket to serve from www.yourdomain.com.
* Checkpoint: Your EB deployment is now only a structured way to retrieve data from your database. All of your UI and application logic is served from the S3 Bucket (via CloudFront). You can support many more users since you're no longer using expensive servers to serve your website's static data.
