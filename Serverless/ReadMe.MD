Serverless

* Write a [AWS Lambda function](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/blob/master/Serverless/lambda_emailDynamoItems.py) to email you a list of all of the Fortunes in the DynamoDB table every night. Implement Least Privilege security for the Lambda Role. (Hint: Lambda using Python 3, Boto3, Amazon SES, scheduled with CloudWatch)
* Refactor the above app into a Serverless app. This is where it get's a little more abstract and you'll have to do a lot of research, experimentation on your own.
* The architecture: Static S3 Website Front-End calls API Gateway which executes a Lambda Function which reads/updates data in the DyanmoDB table.
* Use your SSL enabled bucket as the primary domain landing page with static content.
* Create an AWS API Gateway, use it to forward HTTP requests to an AWS Lambda function that queries the same data from DynamoDB as your EB Microservice.
* Your S3 static content should make Javascript calls to the API Gateway and then update the page with the retrieved data.
* Once you have the "Get Fortune" API Gateway + Lambda working, do the "New Fortune" API.
* Checkpoint: Your API Gateway and S3 Bucket are fronted by CloudFront with SSL. You have no EC2 instances deployed. All work is done by AWS services and billed as consumed.
