# AWS-Project


Well, I found one, and used it as a guide to make [This](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/blob/master/gitignore.md).

It's actually the steps from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8inzn5/so_you_want_to_learn_aws_aka_how_do_i_learn_to_be/), but instead, linking to my code or the files containing the code, which is all listed in this github [here](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project).

The goal here is to simplify the process for any potential empolyers to view what ive done in a somewhat organized manner. 

This project is a work in progress (as of March 25 2020), has gone under many revisions, and will be expanded upon to include more services over time.

Hey,
Thanks for checking out my repo.
This repo is where I store all the code I write and use to build things within AWS.
I didnt have any forethought in the way the directories were named, and how they would appear long term, so I will attempt to guide you through what you're looking at with links below. 


I needed a project to learn AWS services after being certified. I found this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8inzn5/so_you_want_to_learn_aws_aka_how_do_i_learn_to_be/).
