# Hello
Hey,
Thanks for checking out my repo.
This repo is where I store all the code I write and use to build things within AWS.
I didnt have any forethought in the way the directories were named, and how they would appear long term, so I will attempt to guide you through what you're looking at with links below.

# Project Overview
I needed a project to learn AWS services after being certified. I found this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8inzn5/so_you_want_to_learn_aws_aka_how_do_i_learn_to_be/), which roughly states:
"This uses a website as an excuse to use a number of AWS technologies. Its a rough guide of the the maturity process of the most basic webpafe, to an extremely cheap and scalable web application."

The idea for said web appliaction, is a "Fortune of the day" site. A page that, on site load, loads a random fortune from a database, and allows users to add their own fortune to said database.  

# Account Basics
[Code](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/tree/master/Account%20Basics).

This section was focused around setting up a new account and establishing basic AWS security and account recomendations. It has been automated via cloudformation, but I do need to come back and document how to do some of these things via the CLI.


[Web Hosting Basics](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/tree/master/Basic%20Web%20Host).

I think "web hosting basics" is pretty vague. This could incorporate reverse proxies, as well as being able to create a VPC network. I am going to assume both, and need to add script to automate both of these. What is done, is the script to automate a basic static website hosted with apache.  I would like to add the automation of an AMI snapshot. 


[Auto Scaling](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/tree/master/AutoScaling).

I have two scripts that automate the previous website, from an AMI,  into both target target tracking and simple scaling policies from a launchtemplate.

[External Data](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/tree/master/External%20Data).

This one has been tough, i got stuck a couple different times. Once i was troubleshooting a syntax error for far too long, simply overlooking the error. The other issue, is that secondary instances of my website overwrite each others entries. I have some ideas on how to solve it, seemingly issues with my node.js, but ill save that for later when I do deep dives on different code languages. 

[Web Hosting Platform-as-a-Service](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/tree/master/Web%20Hosting%20-%20Platform%20as%20a%20Service)

I havent started this yet but ive played with some of the technologies in a few other projects. Will be starting ASAP

[Microservices](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/tree/master/Microservices).

Havent Started.

[Serverless](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/tree/master/Serverless).

Havent Started. 

[Cost Analysis](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/tree/master/Cost%20Analysis).

Havent Started. 

Automation

Theres no link to this section as part of the entire point of working with the cloud is automation, and thats all listed here. If I do add this section it will be to showcase some new automation technology I havent done before like ansible. 

[Continuous Delivery](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/tree/master/CICD).

Havent started, but ive used CodePipeline before so Im brainstorming when i could start implementing it again.
